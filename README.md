Bulk processing of Amazon ads as a csv.

Apply rules to Amazon Bulk Edit xslx files imported as csvs, with output as csv to be converted to xslx & uploaded to Amazon.

Specific rules for my own use. Use at your own risk.

Redirect the output to a text file. Open that file in VSCode, copy and paste it into a blank sheet in Excel after first formatting all cells in that sheet to Text.
